# WordleProgram

Small program I made to try and find good wordle starting words. It's based on my thought to look for what letters show up the most.
Then find words that use the top five letters. I only did a quick search for a list of five letter words so I think that is the 
current weak point of the program. If you have a better word list you just need to update the words.txt with each word on its own line.
